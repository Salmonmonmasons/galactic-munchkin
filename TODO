--------- Basic Functionality ---------
- Create card object with all necessary attributes
- Player objects to keep track of level and power
- A way to trigger card effects when drawn/played for those that require it (remove the dependecy on an honor system to carry out effects)
- A way for players to help each other out in battle (be able to select the helper or offer help for predetermined reward options).




--------- If time allows ---------
- Server connectivity with AWS for online play
- Art for cards
- Clever descriptions for the lulz
