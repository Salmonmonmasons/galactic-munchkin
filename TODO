TODO:

--------- Basic Functionality ---------
- Create card object with all necessary attributes
- Player objects to keep track of level and power
- A way to trigger card effects when drawn/played for those that require it (remove the dependecy on an honor system to carry out effects)
- A way for players to help each other out in battle (be able to select the helper or offer help for predetermined reward options).
- 

--------- If time allows ---------
- Server connectivity with AWS for online play
	- Maybe a system where one player creates an instance of the game and can provide friends with a game code so they can connect to specific game instance (no matchmaking, too hard)
- Art for cards
- Clever descriptions for the lulz
